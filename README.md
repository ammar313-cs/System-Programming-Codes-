 <h1>System Programming with C - University 6th Semester</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains files related to a system programming course taught in the 6th semester of university. The course covers essential concepts and techniques in system programming using the C programming language.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Threads and Processes</strong>: Files like <code>thread.c</code> demonstrate concepts related to multithreading and multiprocessing, including thread creation, synchronization, and inter-process communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Synchronization Mechanisms</strong>: Examples such as <code>semaphore.c</code> and <code>barrier.c</code> explore synchronization mechanisms like semaphores and barriers, essential for managing shared resources in concurrent programming.</li>
  <li><strong>Inter-Process Communication</strong>: Files like <code>shm_producer.c</code> and <code>shm_consumer.c</code> illustrate techniques for inter-process communication using shared memory, facilitating data exchange between processes.</li>
  <li><strong>File I/O and System Calls</strong>: Examples like <code>task1.c</code> and <code>task2.c</code> delve into file I/O operations and system calls, covering topics such as file handling, directory manipulation, and system call invocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Concepts</strong>: Files like <code>q1.c</code>, <code>q2.c</code>, and <code>q3.c</code> address more advanced topics in system programming, including socket programming, network communication, and system-level debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, students learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to develop robust and efficient C programs for system-level tasks.</li>
  <li>Principles of concurrency and synchronization in multi-threaded and multi-process environments.</li>
  <li>Techniques for inter-process communication and shared memory management.</li>
  <li>Practical application of system calls for file I/O, process management, and networking.</li>
  <li>Strategies for debugging and troubleshooting system-level issues using advanced debugging tools and techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>As per the university's academic policies, the source code and course materials are provided for educational purposes only. Students are encouraged to experiment with the code and explore additional resources to deepen their understanding of system programming concepts.</p>
